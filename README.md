# SOLID Design Principles

Explanation and exemplification of the five SOLID Design Principles, proposed by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). In a few words, these are guidelines that encourage developers to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software.

SOLID stands for:

- S: Single Responsibility Principle
- O: Open-Closed Principle
- L: Liskov-Substitution Principle
- I: Interface Segregation Principle
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle

We'll explain and exemplify each of them!
